# Weather Forecast App

A responsive, dynamic weather application built as part of **The Odin Project** JavaScript curriculum. Users can search any city to see current conditions and a 14-day forecast. The app integrates the Visual Crossing Weather API for data, the Giphy API for a fun loading animation, and dynamic background videos that adapt to the weather. Temperature units toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit, and the interface automatically displays in English or Russian based on the user‚Äôs browser settings.
